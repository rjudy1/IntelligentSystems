# HW 4 Python Files
The code contains two files neuron.py which contains the Neuron class used in the network while the network.py file
contains the network, weight saving and loading code, and the main functions. This code should be reusable
for various networks. The neuron.py file must be in the same folder as the network.py

## Dependencies
- python3
- matplotlib
- numpy
- random

## Usage
In order to run the code provided, simply run `python network.py`.
