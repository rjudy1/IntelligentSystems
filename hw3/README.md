# HW 3 Python File
The code contains a function to split the provided MNIST data set into a training, test, and challenge set as well as 
a Perceptron class that implements tests, challenges, and training functionality for a perceptron. When run, it creates
and trains two perceptrons for differentiating between 0s and 1s v 0s and 9s and generates plots representing the training
and performance.

## Dependencies
- python3
- matplotlib
- numpy
- random

## Usage
In order to run the code provided, simply run `python hw3.py`. This will simulate the perceptron between 0s and 1s
and the 0s and 9s, presenting the relevant plots. 

The `Perceptron` class is meant to be modifiable for other neurons to change the training model.
